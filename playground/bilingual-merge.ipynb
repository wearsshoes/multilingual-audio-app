So, in general, women in our society were deprived of access to education. They were deprived of having access to the right to being educated or being independent economically or having their own business, so one of the things that we started to do was to provide some basic economical project for them so we can, like, enhance the culture of women having their independent economy. Okay, what did that program teach, or if there are multiple, which things did they teach? Well, via these economical projects, women could have a big opportunity to become more independent economically and financially, and also they now are aware and they know they can have something, have a business themselves. We know women in our society were deprived of inheriting their family heritage, were Society didn't trust women in business because they said women cannot run a business, but now it's different. We see now women are working on their private projects, whether patisserie, whether kindergarten, whether bakeries, and other projects that were allocated for women only, like for women business. The things that you need to teach women in order to run their own business, are these mostly practical things? They need to learn the skills, or is it like they need to learn negotiation with the community so that the community doesn't, you know, that will allow them to run this? So, in our society, the idea of women business wasn't accepted, and especially after ISIS time, like ISIS enhanced this idea that women should stay at their houses and only take care of their families, and not to get out of their houses. So, it was really hard to change this mentality, to tell the society that women also are capable, women can run their own business, women are even like more successful sometimes when they are running their business professionally. We started with giving training for women, like practical training regarding how to, for example, cook, how to do like coiffer work, how to do the sewing work, and like as time passed, this idea became more acceptable by the society because women now, they are helping their society even with the money they earn. And even we have discovered that women are really active in some specific business that are very popular here. For example, the Saj bread, which is very famous and popular here, it belongs to the culture of this region. Now women have more than one patisserie or bakery that are making this kind of bread, and also women who are working in agricultural lands and doing the harvesting and working in the lands, it's very popular here and they have proven that they are able to do this. So here, we encouraged women in engaging in business and we also covered the needs of the society for the work that they are doing and the services they are providing. Yeah, obviously, as people understand that you're capable of doing this,\", 'task': 'transcribe', 'language': 'english', 'duration': 390.989990234375, 'segments': [{'id': 0, 'seek': 0, 'start':
